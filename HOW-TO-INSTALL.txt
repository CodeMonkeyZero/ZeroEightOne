*** BE SURE TO READ THE VERY FIRST POST IN THE THREAD. ***
IT CONTAINS DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING PSEUDOTV LIVE.

THE COMMUNITY IS VERY HELPFUL, but you are expected to help yourself or at least help them to help you.
Asking silly questions that were clearly answered in the directions is severely frowned upon. 

Good luck and enjoy,
